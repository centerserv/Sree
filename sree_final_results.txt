SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE NOTE FOR GROK
================================================================================
IMPORTANT: SREE is a GENERIC, ADAPTABLE system designed for ANY dataset type.
This demonstration uses the Heart Disease dataset as an example, but the
system architecture is completely dataset-agnostic and can be applied to:
- Medical datasets (heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc.)
- Financial datasets (fraud detection, risk assessment)
- Image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, medical imaging)
- Text datasets (sentiment analysis, document classification)
- Sensor datasets (IoT, industrial monitoring)
- Any other tabular or structured data

The PPP (Pattern, Presence, Permanence) architecture automatically adapts
to the characteristics of any input dataset without requiring manual
configuration or domain-specific tuning.
